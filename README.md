## 🗺️Overview

The Disappearing Text Writing App is a desktop application designed to help users enhance their typing skills and focus. The application provides a unique challenge where the text starts to disappear if the user stops typing for a predetermined amount of time.

## 👨‍💻Technologies

- **Python**: The core programming language used for development.
- **CustomTkinter**: Enhanced tkinter module for improved GUI components.

## 👀Features

- **Dynamic Disappearance**: Text disappears dynamically if the user stops typing, resetting the disappearance timer with each keystroke.
- **Adjustable Timer**: Users can set the duration after which the text will start to disappear once they stop typing.
- **Focus Mode**: Forces users to keep typing or lose their progress, enhancing concentration and typing discipline.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides a simple and interactive GUI for easy operation.

## 🗃️Project Structure

- `main.py`: Main application script that initializes the GUI and handles the logic.
